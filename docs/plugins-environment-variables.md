## The basics

All of Mailchimp Open Commerce's features are provided by plugins, either first-party or third-party. This structure gives you complete control over what plugins and features are active in your installation. First-party Open Commerce services are distributed as Docker images, or can be customized and then built into your own Docker image. 

Much of the platform-wide configuration of Open Commerce is set via environment variablesâ€”either to pass information from one service to another or simply to customize the platform to meet your needs. Some environment variable values are required, while others are optional. Each plugin should supply sensible defaults for required values, and the development platform's `make` scripts automatically set up required `.env` files for you.

This documentation outlines the plugins included in the development platform, as well as common environment variables and their functions. For more information about making data available throughout your Open Commerce installation, see the [Sharing Code Between Plugins](/open-commerce/docs/sharing-code-between-plugins/) doc.


## Plugins

A wide range of first-party plugins covers all the basic platform features, including the [API core](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/api-core), handling backend services, shop configuration, and the shopper experience. You can view a list of the plugins active in your instance in the admin dashboard under **Settings > System Information**.

## Environment variables

You can set variables in each service's `.env` file, which is used by Docker Compose when starting the system and loading plugins. Each Open Commerce repo contains a `.env.example` file that lists the environment variables and default values for that project. You can run the `bin/setup` script within the project to automatically copy the contents of `.env.example` to `.env` (although it will not overwrite existing values). Your `.env` files will contain personalized and potentially sensitive information, so you should never commit them to a public GitHub repo.

In some cases, projects may look for additional environment variables that are not listed in `.env.example` because they are optional and have default values set in the code. You can find these optional variables by searching for `cleanEnv` within a Node project.

The following tables detail the environment variables used by the API core, storefront, and admin services.
